# Base 10 Number System

Decimal system uses 10 as a **base** and the numbers range from **0 to 9**

Let’s look at a few example numbers

We start with the three digit number **129** (one hundred and twenty nine).

This made up of **100 +20 +9 =129**

If we look at the diagram below we see that as we move from right to left the columns increase by a factor of 10.

The 2 in the second column isn’t 2 but is 2\*10=20 and the 1 in the third column isn’t 1 but 1\*10\*10=100.

![decimal-power-notation](http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/wp-content/uploads/decimal-power-notation.jpg) means 10 raised to the power of 0. This is equal to 1 and represents our units column.

The short table below shows a few more entries using the power notation.

When writing decimal numbers we rarely write column values above the numbers as we already know what they are so we simply write:

**129** and not ![decimal-number-powers](http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/wp-content/uploads/decimal-number-powers.jpg)

I have introduced the power notation because it is fundamental to understanding binary numbers.

The minimum number possible with three digits is **000** and the maximum is **999.** For numbers larger than **999** we need a 4th column which with be the 1000s column.
