# Maths

Maths is everywhere, from sciene to economics. The universe is strictly following these laws set in nature whether we choose to write it down/represent them in our language or not.

Maths is just translating these divine laws of nature into something we humans can understand.
Its not something tangiable but its set in stone.

`1 + 1 = 2` is true all around the universe, it was true even before we were able to write it down.

`Math is the study of questions that have definite answers.`

Math is Objective truth.

We do not decide the answers, we simply observe them and come up with tools to explain these mathematical phenomenons in best possible way.

Pursuing Maths is just pursuing anything else, like art of sciences, you may or may not use it in your day to day life but having the understanding of it will help you better comprehend the nature of reality itself.
