# Writing is thinking

<blockquote>You don't write because you want to say something, you write because you have something to say. <cite>F. Scott Fitzgerald </cite>
 </blockquote>

To improve upon this quote, you don't always write because you have something to say but you also write to find out what you want to say.

Writing is thinking because writing lets you freeze a thought in space (paper or digital notebooks) and think about it, it lets you explore an idea and truly absorb it.

Writing helps you navigate inside your own mind and it helps you create strategies which help you implement ideas into action and [[action-creates-impact]]

Writing doesn't have to get complicated, you can use a simple notepad or a software, just string words together and explore them.
It can be as simple as writing what you're feeling, what you're doing or any stream of your consciousness.

Writing helps you breakdown complex, abstract ideas into something tangiable so you can work on it.
You can write your worries and anxities down and you'll realize how defeatable they become.

You don't have to write till it meets perfection, let it be brain vomit, you can also go back and revise them.

Writing also helps in critical thinking, writing can give you a different perspective and insights which might not have birthed if you had just thought about that topic.
