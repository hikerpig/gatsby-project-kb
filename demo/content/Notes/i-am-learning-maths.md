# I am learning Maths

I've always struggled with [[Maths]], maybe it was just that I got really shitty teachers at school, I don't remember where I went wrong. There was a point I declared that Maths doesn't like me and I don't like Maths.

But as I got older and my understanding of the world changed, I soon realized how fundamental Maths is to us and the nature of reality itself. Its something to not shy away from, its something to embrace.

I kept telling myself that I will make ammends with Maths but I wasn't sure when I was gonna do that, I needed to set consequences for myself, a little gamification.

So, when I decided to appear for the GRE test, I realized this was a perfect opportunity for me to revise Maths and set myself up for a whole new level of understanding of the world, who knows, perhaps even a new career stream?

I am going to start with ground zero because believe me when I say I suck at Maths, I really do and I don't want to leave any stones unturned this time.

**We gonna learn all of it**, which is why I am following this great series of tutorials by Professor Dave on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0cd_-e49hZpWLH3UIwoWRA).

When it comes to Maths most people suffer with mathphobia that results from a [[fixed-mindset]], while I've embraced the [[growth-mindset]], I am still not confident, I doubt in my ability to get good at Maths as a result of my traumatic experience with Maths in the past.

Here are a few things that I am gonna do to get better at Maths and stop this irrational fear of something so fundamental to us.

- ## Plugging in

When you see variables in the answer choices or in the problem, you do have to do algebra. In fact, algebra often gets you into trouble. By learning the technique of plugging in numbers you can make a seemingly intractable problem seem that much easier.

- ## Approximation/Estimation

When you're facing multiple-choice (except for the numeric entry question). Learn to look at the spread between the answer choices. Are the answer choices very close together? Are some nice round numbers, and other unpleasant, unwieldy numbers, such as 119? Often you will be presented with answer choices in such a way that you can eliminate a few obviously wrong answers, and then home in on the correct answer by approximating

- ## Know your fundamentals

  At the end of the day, you have to know how to add fractions, the formula for area of the circle, how to solve work rate problems, or the rules of exponents. Learn the basics and feel comfortable applying them. Learn most of the major formulas. But remember, they are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to solving a problem.

- ## Learn how to unravel the question

Imagine the math problem is a riddle, and you must unravel it. In other words, you must figure out what the question is asking, and then arrive at a solution path, i.e., the necessary steps to arrive at the correct answer.

Typically, the formula stuff only comes at the very end. A common misconception amongst students is that they only need to know a formula to solve a question. This is often decidedly not the case. Without unraveling the problem first, having a formula isn’t going to get you anywhere.

- ## The Math formula trap
  Many students feel that all they have to do is use the formulas and they can solve a question. The reality is you must first decipher what the question is asking. Only at the very end, once you know how the different parts come together, can you “set up” the question.  
  All too often, many students let the formulas do the thinking. By that I mean they see a word problem, say a distance/rate question, and instead of deconstructing the problem, they instantly come up with d(distance) = r(rate) x t(time) and start plugging in parts of the question. In other words, they expect the question to fall neatly into the formula.

If you find yourself stuck in a problem with only a formula or two in hand, remember that the essence of problem solving is just that: solving the problem using logic, so you can use the formula when appropriate.

- ## Use training wheels!

Many students learn some basic concepts/formulae and feel that they have the hang of it. As soon as they are thrown into a random fray of questions, they become discombobulated, uncertain of exactly what problem type they are dealing with.

Basic problems, such as those you find in the Manhattan GRE math books, are an excellent way to begin studying. You get to build off the basic concepts in a chapter and solve problems of easy to medium difficulty. This phase, however, represents the “training wheels.”

Actually riding a bike, much like successfully answering a potpourri of questions, hinges on doing GRE math practice sessions that take you out of your comfort zone. In other words, you should try a few questions chosen at random. Opening up the Official Guide to the GRE and doing the first math questions you see is a good start. Even if you haven’t seen the concept, just so you can get a feel for working through a question will limited information.

The reality is that students can actually solve many problems based on what they already know but because of "cloaks" in the questions, many familiar concepts are disguised in a welter of verbiage or other such obfuscation.
