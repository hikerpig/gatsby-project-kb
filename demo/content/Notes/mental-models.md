# Mental models

<blockquote> We all have mental models: the lens through which we
  see the world that drive our responses to everything we
 experience. Being aware of your mental models is key to
  being objective. <br /> <cite>Elizabeth Thornton</cite>
</blockquote>

Mental Models are simply our beliefs, assumptions, frameworks that we consciously or unconciously develop based on our life experiences. They're our reasoning tools, why we think things are the way they're. This can be rooted in our biology, our environment or in our psychology.

Here's a list of Mental Models that I've read about and experienced.

- [[Anchoring]]
- [[Classical-conditioning]]
- [[Commitment-and-consistency-bias]]

This list will be improved soon.
