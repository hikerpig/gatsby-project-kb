# Public Learning

A big responsibility when learning anything is holding yourself accountable, public learning enables you to share what you're learning with others and it forces a commitment on you which is now known to public.

Publicly committing to doing something (in our case, learning) keeps you motivated and accountable.  
You're now answerable not just to yourself but to others (who care about you).  
This prevents you from going off-track or abandoning your goal.

You can either share your work on your social media accounts or it can be as simple as updating your friends on your progress.

Publicy sharing your work will also invite others like yourself who you can collaborate with, it also brings criticism which(if its constructive) you can take and work upon.

You're allowing your assumptions and biases to be challenged by others, which encourages discourse, it may make you vulnerable but at the same time it welcomes other's perspective and insight into your work and one of the best way we learn is by discourse and debate.
