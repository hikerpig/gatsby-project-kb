# How to use this for work

The workflow of P.A.R.A. is very much based around projects, as this is based on the actionability of information. Information and files will flow in the various layer of the system as you use them. That is best explained with examples:

## Example 1

This is the "normal" workflow for most things. You start with a project, something like writing this starter kit.

From there, you do the project taking notes from the note you saved or other folders and put them all together in the project folder. This is the first flow, pulling notes from all over the A.R. parts into the project folder. Then complete the project. 

After you're done with the project, we get into the 2nd flow of notes. Look at the file you've created from the project and the note you pulled in, and if you think they can still be useful, move them to their respective Areas and Resources. On the other hand, if they're not helpful or can't be templated, move them to Archive. 

## Example 2

This one will be the capture workflow. You should capture note from places into an inbox (if you plan on using Obsidian for this, you could create a 0. Inbox for this purpose) then sort them once in a while. When you do your sort, it's usually fairly easy, just put the note in their related subfolder. That's one of the nice things about P.A.R.A. the sorting is rapid and easy.

Sometimes though, there will be a thing that might fit into 2 folders. When that happens, the next question is, where will this be most useful next? Since the system is based on actionability, things go where they're more actionable next. 

## Example 3

You decided to change your job and launch your own business. This would mean you would take the information in the Area of your old work and redistribute them in Resources, Projects (if the new job is related), or Archive. That is how things would flow across the P.A.R.A. system.
