Mindful eating is simply making yourself aware of what you are eating and how much you are eating. When we eat mindfully, we focus on things such as the color of our food, the portion size, the way it is plated, where the food came from, how we feel when we're eating it and how the food is going to nourish our bodies.

A recent study showed that mindfulness -- and not certain foods -- is what leads to weight loss and better health. The study concluded that, “Increased mindful eating has been shown to help participants gain awareness of their bodies, be more in tune to hunger and satiety, recognize external cues to eat, gain self-compassion, decrease food cravings, decrease problematic eating and decrease reward-driven eating.”

Look at your food and notice its color, texture and size. Take a bite and chew very slowly, and make yourself aware of the sensation of the smell, taste and texture. Keep chewing, because many of us swallow food prematurely, which can lead to indigestion, cramping and, naturally, overeating and weight gain.

Take at least 20 minutes to eat your meal, pause in between bites and put your fork down. If this is difficult for you, make “fast eating” physically challenging by eating with your non-dominant hand or by using chopsticks.

Use your mind. Be grateful for your food and think about where it came from, who prepared it for you (even if you prepared it, be grateful for that!) and specific seasonings or flavors that you enjoy. Think about how the food makes you feel while you eat it and especially afterwards, as this can help you make better decisions about your nutrition going forward. Does something give you energy? Does it make you lethargic? Do you regret eating something? Think about why you are eating and what you are putting in your mouth, learning to truly enjoy and appreciate simple and healthful food.
