Most full-time workers spend about 40 hours each week on the job, accounting for roughly 35 percent of their waking moments. That’s a huge emotional, physical and mental commitment. Accordingly, greater numbers of employees are seeking jobs at places where they can feel at home and forge real relationships.

Last fall, Gallup reported that just 34 percent of U.S. workers were engaged

In a study of almost 1.9 million employees, Gallup researchers found that engaged employees outperformed their unengaged counterparts in key performance areas such as customer ratings, productivity and profitability. In fact, according to the firm's State of the American Workplace Report, disengaged employees could be costing the U.S. between $483 billion and $605 billion in lost productivity every year.

Consider adopting a mix of public and private platforms so team members can contact each other in preferred ways, depending upon the situation

Apps such as Slack and Asana encourage informal interaction and can help employees bond across departments. If your team communications require greater security, setting up an intranet will provide a safer portal. You may even want to give employees a private blog or chat boards so they can expand their work networks and feel more connected to one another

You can help your team do likewise, but only if you’re willing to pave a two-way street that encourages innovative ideas and respectful questioning.

When you begin to ask for specific feedback and take responses into consideration, though, you'll inevitably change the tone of your workplace. Start today by asking a direct report how you can be a more helpful leader or how you can better support a specific project.

Simpplr’s State of the Intranet report found that two-thirds of leaders only communicate with their teams about company strategy or vision quarterly, or even less than that.

==It’s hard for employees to stay engaged when they feel they’re being kept in the dark==

Monthly or quarterly all-team meetings are a great opportunity to give employees a big-picture view of how the company is doing and the goals it’s working toward. Weekly team meetings can be used to tie specific projects back to the company’s objectives and brainstorm ways to remove obstacles.

Focus your attention on improving communication between -- and with -- your employees, and you'll enjoy the benefits of having more mutually supportive, engaged team players on your roster.
