## Definitions
- Projects  => Every current projects (see def. below) that are actionable with their notes, files, artifacts
- Areas => Zone of responsibility with standard to uphold over long periods, parent, animals, management, coding, house
- Resources => Zone of interest for various topics that don’t require standard/responsibility, game, phone, productivity, self development, technology
- Archive => Where things from all the other category become unused, finished, change of responsibility etc

A project is something with a goal and a deadline that requires more than 1 step to complete
A project packet is an intermediate step before the completion that is itself a “thing” made and that could be reused or serves as a snapshot of progress

## Workflow
### Projects flow
Project -> Areas -> Resources -> Archive

Project -> AreasA project turned into something more after finishing it. Eg. new responsibility over the thing made, new job opportunity etc
Project -> ResourcesA part of the project packet or the thing made could be reused in other ways later. Eg. PowerPoint layout, book resume, study notes etc
Project -> ArchiveOnce the project is finished, areas and resources information or packet have been moved what’s left goes into archive for conservation and possible reuse later
