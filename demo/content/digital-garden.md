# Digital Garden

Digital Garden/ing is the process of collecting notes that evolve over time. You link these ideas with each other with something called [[bi-directional linking]] which allows you to jump around from one idea to another freely, bi-directional links helps ideas be aware of other ideas that reference them, unlike uni-directional links that lead to dead ends.

If you'd like to know about my workspace and my tools, I'll write a blog post on my [main website](https://zubayrali.in) soon.

In the meantime, here is a great list of fellow [digital gardeners](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) and resources curated by [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com).
