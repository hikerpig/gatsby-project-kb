# Motivated Reasoning or Soldier mindset

## “CAN I BELIEVE IT?” VS. “MUST I BELIEVE IT?”

Directionally motivated reasoning—or, more often, just motivated reasoning—in which our unconscious motives affect the conclusions we draw. Tom Gilovich describes it as, When we want something to be true, he said, we ask ourselves, “Can I believe this?,” searching for an excuse to accept it. When we don’t want something to be true, we instead ask ourselves, “Must I believe this?,” searching for an excuse to reject it.

It’s all around you under different names—denial, wishful thinking, confirmation bias, rationalization, tribalism, self-justification, overconfidence, delusion.

You can see it in the way people happily share news stories that support their narratives about America or capitalism or “kids today,” while ignoring stories that don’t. You can see it in the way we rationalize away red flags in an exciting new relationship, and always think we’re doing more than our fair share of the work. When a coworker screws up, it’s because they’re incompetent, but when we screw up, it’s because we were under a lot of pressure. When a politician from the rival party breaks the law, it proves how corrupt that whole party is, but when one of our politicians breaks the law, he’s just a corrupt individual.

Even two thousand years ago, Greek historian Thucydides described the motivated reasoning of the cities that believed they could overthrow their Athenian rulers: “[Their] judgment was based more upon blind wishing than upon any sound prediction; for it is a habit of mankind . . . to use sovereign reason to thrust aside what they do not desire.”

## REASONING AS DEFENSIVE COMBAT

Beneath the surface of our conscious awareness, it’s as if we’re soldiers, defending our beliefs against threatening evidence. In fact, the metaphor of reasoning as a kind of defensive combat is baked right into the English language, so much so that it’s difficult to speak about reasoning at all without using militaristic language.

We talk about our beliefs as if they’re military positions, or even fortresses, built to resist attack. Beliefs can be deep-rooted, well-grounded, built on fact, and backed up by arguments. They rest on solid foundations. We might hold a firm conviction or a strong opinion, be secure in our beliefs or have unshakeable faith in something.

Arguments are either forms of attack or forms of defense. If we’re not careful, someone might poke holes in our logic or shoot down our ideas. We might encounter a knock-down argument against something we believe. Our positions might get challenged, destroyed, undermined, or weakened. So we look for evidence to support, bolster, or buttress our position. Over time, our views become reinforced, fortified, and cemented. And we become entrenched in our beliefs, like soldiers holed up in a trench, safe from the enemy’s volleys.

And if we do change our minds? That’s surrender. If a fact is inescapable, we might admit, grant, or allow it, as if we’re letting it inside our walls. If we realize our position is indefensible, we might abandon it, give it up, or concede a point, as if we’re ceding ground in a battle.

Even words that don’t seem to have any connection to the defensive combat metaphor often reveal one when you dig into their origins. To rebut a claim is to argue that it’s untrue, but the word originally referred to repelling an attack. Have you heard of someone being a staunch believer? A staunch is a solidly constructed wall. Or perhaps you’ve heard of someone being adamant in their beliefs, a word that once referred to a mythical unbreakable stone.

## “IS IT TRUE?”

cognitive scientists sometimes call [[accuracy-motivated-reasoning]]. In contrast to directionally motivated reasoning, which evaluates ideas through the lenses of “Can I believe it?” and “Must I believe it?,” accuracy motivated reasoning evaluates ideas through the lens of “Is it true?”
