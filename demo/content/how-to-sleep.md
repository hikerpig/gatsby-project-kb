# How to sleep

`Here are some notes that I collected when I was reading Rafael Pelayo's book "How to Sleep The New Science-Based Solutions for Sleeping Through the Night"`

---

The term sleep hygiene, widely used by both health professionals and the general public, refers to isolated recommendations of things to avoid, such as “Don’t read in bed,” “Don’t drink coffee close to bedtime,” “Don’t watch TV in bed,” and “Don’t drink alcohol before bedtime.” The concept, popularized by the late great Dr. Peter Hauri, was well-intentioned and has helped generate awareness of the importance of sleep. But despite the popularity of these old rules, improving one’s sleep hygiene alone is rarely effective in helping people with serious sleep problems.

Despite knowing these rules for decades, millions of people continue to battle sleep difficulties.

According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, research clearly shows that the efficacy of sleep hygiene rules alone is weak and inconclusive at best. This is because applying those rules ignores the core issues that cause sleep disorders. If anything, it can backfire, because when people try to use sleep hygiene rules and still sleep poorly, they blame themselves or become resigned to poor sleep because they’ve “tried everything.” It’s a kitchen-sink approach that fails to address each person’s specific issues.

Its time we looked for new rules/approach with modern science to help us get rid of the sleep-epidemic.

# How sleep works

Early scientists believed that sleep was little more than an inactive state. It wasn’t until brain-wave activity could be reliably monitored that we discovered that our journey through the night is fascinating and complex—and far from inactive. There is a lot going on while we’re sleeping, and scientific studies of the sleeping brain are revealing not only how the human organism functions during sleep but also how our sleep affects us while we’re awake. The mystery of sleep is no longer so mysterious.

## Circadian Rhythms

Inside our heads is what’s known as the circadian or biological clock. This miniature timekeeper consists of a tiny cluster of neurons that shares one purpose: to synchronize the body’s biological rhythms with the earth’s cycles of dawn and dusk.

This clock is located in the perfect place: at the base of the brain, right behind our eyes and above the junction of our optic nerves, which transmit information to the circadian clock about the light that is coming into our eyes.

The circadian clock’s internal rhythm runs slightly longer than twenty-four hours, to predict the incremental changes in the earth’s rotational tilt that affect the length of our days and nights across the seasons, so it tends to overshoot. But it resets at the first burst of light to hit our eyes when we wake in the morning. Once the brain knows what time the light hits our eyes, it can predict that dawn will occur around the same time the next day.

Our circadian clock sends us signals to begin the process of falling asleep as nighttime comes, and it emits chemicals to naturally wake us up as dawn approaches. Our goal should be to work with this clock instead of fight against it.

With the prevalence of artificial light, many of us are trapped into thinking it’s always a short summer night and end up sleeping as little as possible! (This is why it’s important to control your light situation for optimal sleep wherever you are.

## You Are Most Awake Before You Go to Sleep

Sleep and alertness work in a more complex way.

Most of us wake up somewhat sleepy, even if we’ve had a normal, restful night’s sleep. We become more alert as the morning goes on. We may begin to feel drowsy again in the afternoon.
If we can shake off our afternoon slump, in the evening we will find ourselves feeling more alert than we were earlier in the day even though our ‘“tank” is nearly empty.

The reason for this is that while the pressure to sleep builds the longer we stay awake, our circadian clock sends an alerting signal to the brain to counter this pressure. This signal is most powerful about two hours before we normally go to sleep. This accounts for the “second wind” many people claim to experience at night. It also explains why it is easier to stay up late than it is to go to sleep earlier than usual.

This circadian modulation of sleepiness and alertness helped ensure our survival: We are most alert close to bedtime because this is when our former predators, like lions and tigers, are on the hunt. We balance this peak of alertness with a lull when the day is at its hottest and predators are having a lull of their own. The clock in our heads is a truly amazing legacy of our evolution.

## Sleep Is an Active Process

For centuries, sleep was considered a passive, almost deathlike state. But with the advent of modern sleep science, we now know that sleep is an active process. The brain is not turned off but instead goes through predictable cycles of various sleep patterns known as sleep stages. The repetitive combination of sleep stages is referred to as a person’s sleep architecture.

The modern era of sleep science was born in the 1950s when scientists began combining measurements of brain waves with other electrical signals from the body. To help make sense of the measurements, scientists divided sleep into two distinct modes: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Since 75 to 80 percent of our sleep time is in NREM, scientists further divide it into three stages that correspond to light, intermediate, and deep sleep (N1, N2, and N3, respectively).

Many significant things occur during NREM, including the physical growth of our bodies and memory consolidation. NREM sleep is even thought to have a key function in the restoration of our brains by resetting our brain synapses. In NREM we have our deepest sleep.

---

In the N1 period of NREM sleep, we transition from the awake state into sleep. We become much less aware of the outside world as we turn inward. Our eyes close and start to slowly roll back in our heads. In this drowsy state, we may think we are still awake, but anyone watching us can see we are checking out.

In N2, which takes up about half of our total sleep time, we have bursts of unique brain-wave patterns called sleep spindles and K-complexes. Sleep spindles are thought to play a role in the brain forming declarative, or explicit, memories—memories of facts and occurrences that can be consciously recalled, such as specific events in our lives or new information we learned that day.

N3 (commonly referred to as slow-wave sleep) is our deepest sleep. Dominating the first third of the night, N3 takes up 10 percent or less of total adult sleep time (children and teenagers will have as much as 20 percent and sometimes even more N3 sleep). In N3, our breathing and heart rate reach their lowest point. This is the period when it is the most difficult to wake us up. N3 is when our brains secrete the most growth hormone (and likely the time when children’s bones actually grow longer—inadequate sleep is associated with growth problems in children). It, too, is thought to play a role in consolidating our memories and may be a future target for therapies for conditions such as dementia. In N3, odd phenomena such as sleepwalking can occur.

REM is the sleep stage most closely associated with dreaming and dominates the last third of the night. Looking solely at brain waves, it is difficult to distinguish REM sleep from being awake, with our eyes open. This implies that the mental activity of looking around while awake and dreaming are similar. (In contrast, when we are awake with our eyes closed, our brain waves look completely different.) Although most of our other muscles stop moving, our eye movements dramatically change as we transition from NREM into REM, with wild, seemingly chaotic movements (hence the name). Our heart rates also fluctuate greatly. If you lead a sedentary lifestyle, REM may be when you reach your peak heart rate on a given day. REM episodes tend to become longer in later sleep cycles, and at the end of the REM bouts, we usually change our sleeping positions and briefly wake up.

Each complete sleep cycle—which can include all of the NREM and REM stages—lasts about ninety minutes, although individual cycles vary throughout the night. As shown in the illustration opposite, we sleep most deeply in the early cycles, and REM is longer and more intense in the later cycles. The first sleep cycle is dominated by our deep, slow-wave sleep and contains very little REM sleep. As the night goes on, this mixture changes, so that by the early-morning hours we have very little of that deep sleep, and REM sleep prevails. (This is why we have our longest and most intense dreams just before we wake up to start our day.)

Many potential clues into people’s sleep problems can be found by analyzing their sleep architecture .

## All Sleep Stages Are Created Equal

You might assume that because slow-wave (N3) sleep helps our bodies and minds recover and reenergize, it is the most important, most refreshing sleep of the night. It is important, and it is refreshing, but slow-wave sleep makes up only about 10 percent of total sleep time in healthy adults. Does that mean that 90 percent of sleep isn’t as necessary? Clearly this is not the case. If slow-wave sleep was the only sleep you got at night, you would feel the full effects of sleep deprivation.

Our brains have some self-correction with regard to our sleep stages. If, for example, we wake up too early and cut off some of our REM time, when we do get a chance to sleep again, we will have more REM sleep than usual. This is called REM pressure and explains why when we are very sleep deprived we may start to dream with our eyes open.

## No One Sleeps through the Night

Each of us wakes up about every ninety minutes in our sleep cycle. We toss, stir, change position, sometimes even open our eyes and scan the room. It’s a phenomenon so brief (lasting less than a minute) that in most instances we don’t remember doing it. Not only do we wake up at ninety-minute intervals, but about ten times an hour we have short arousals lasting approximately three seconds each. In all of these instances, your brain is simply doing what it is supposed to do. If we slept straight through for seven or eight hours in a row, the lions and tigers would have picked us off into extinction long ago! Waking up during the night is normal; having trouble going back to sleep is not. No matter how sleepless you feel, make this your mantra: Sleep will come. It’s a natural function of human biology.

## Sleep Fragmentation: Stuck in First Gear

More than any specific sleep stage, what matters for refreshing sleep is the healthy continuity of the sleep cycles. When these cycles are disrupted, we use the term sleep fragmentation. Think of the natural mixture of sleep stages as your car’s transmission. The normal progression of shifting gears (moving from one sleep stage to the next) allows you to efficiently obtain a smooth ride (a good night’s sleep). But if your transmission is slipping (continuously starting and stopping your sleep), or you’re stuck in first gear (N1 sleep), you will have an inefficient and choppy ride—you’re not getting the good sleep you need.

Your sleep fragmentation may be out of your control but there are some behaviors you can curtail, such as drinking alcohol or caffeine close to bedtime or taking long naps during the day, to prevent sleep fragmentation.

## You Might Not Need Eight Hours of Sleep

An average of seven to eight hours of sleep allows most people to wake up feeling their best, but the optimal number of hours one should sleep depends on the individual and the assumptions that your sleep is normal in quality and its timing is predictable. Ultimately, there’s no magic number of hours you need to sleep each night. Put simply, you need as many hours of sleep as it takes for you to wake up feeling refreshed and remain alert throughout the day. “Short sleepers” seem to have a genetic predisposition to sleep fewer hours than average, while “long sleepers” tend to need more sleep. But if your need for sleep noticeably changes, consult a doctor.

## Can I Get By with Less Sleep?

You may be able to “get by” with less sleep than your body requires, but you are doing only that, getting by. The ability to put off sleep is built into our brains, and we can do it up to a point. We can also skip meals—our physiology has evolved to allow us to temporarily go without the basic necessities. But we do not function at our best in these situations. For optimum mental and physical health, don’t treat sleep like an inconvenience; make it a priority in your life.

## What Happens When We Don’t Sleep?

Sleep consumes one-third of our lives, and poor sleep can severely impair the other two-thirds.

After just twenty-four hours without sleep, a person’s reaction time is similar to that of a drunk driver. When we are fighting to stay awake, we may have brief bouts of sleep called microsleeps, where we might not even realize we have fallen asleep.

Complete sleep deprivation, makes a person increasingly irritable, emotional, and inattentive. Reaction time is further diminished. After not sleeping for three days or more, a person may start to hallucinate and eventually become delirious.

Long-standing sleep deprivation is a stressor on the body, and it is not only associated with a greater risk of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, but also may increase the risk of cancer and serious neurological conditions such as Alzheimer’s.

Simply put, we have to sleep well to be healthy.

## Sleep and Immunity

If you deprive yourself of sleep, your body’s immune system cannot function at its best.

Common wisdom has it that when you feel sick, you should take to your bed. In fact, the release of special immune-system proteins called cytokines—part of the body’s reaction to infection—makes you sleepy, so bed rest is often just what the doctor ordered.
If you don’t get the necessary sleep when you’re fighting off an illness, you are adding to the demands of your body to mount an anti-inflammatory reaction. So if you get sick, don’t try to work your way through it.

You should also be prioritizing sleep before you get sick, as sleep deprivation makes us more prone to getting infections in the first place. Lack of sleep interferes with the immune system’s T-cells, which help us fight infections caused by viruses.

We don’t all require the same amount of sleep each night, but one study showed that people who reported habitually sleeping only five hours per night had an increased risk for developing pneumonia in the next two years, and a higher incidence of respiratory infection in the previous month when compared with people who usually slept seven to eight hours per night.

The good news is that regularly getting a good night’s sleep can actually boost our immune systems, with measurably reduced risk of infections and improved infection outcomes. Even our bodies’ response to vaccinations is affected by our sleep! Sleep really is the ultimate form of self-care.

## Can I Catch Up on Sleep?

When we don’t get enough sleep, that missing sleep does not just go away. It accumulates, just like any other debt. For example, if your daily sleep requirement is seven hours, sleeping five hours a night for one five-day workweek will create a sleep debt of ten hours. The larger the sleep debt, the stronger the tendency to fall asleep during the day and to feel fatigued, among other potential ills.

The only known way to pay off sleep debt? Sleep.

The only way to truly “pay off” your sleep debt is to change the habits that led you to accumulate it in the first place.

## Can I Get Too Much Sleep?

The explanation for this is threefold: First, the ability to sleep twelve hours or more indicates a very large sleep debt, which simply can’t be eliminated in one extended sleep period—it may take a week or so to get back to normal. Second, when you sleep until midday or into the afternoon, you’re waking up close to the classic midday drowsy slump, and the timing of your body’s hormones will be out of sync with their usual rhythm. Third, a long period of immobility can result in muscle aches or stiffness.

Alas, while you can accumulate sleep debt, you cannot store up sleep. A normal, predictable sleep pattern should be the goal each and every night.

## You Should Never Wake Up Tired

It is likely that you are getting too much N1 sleep. This stage is how we naturally enter sleep and is the lightest sleep you can have. Think of it as the first gear in your car’s transmission. You could drive your car across the entire country in first gear, but it would be inefficient and prevent your car from performing optimally. In the same way, sleeping through the night in N1 will leave you feeling tired.

## Will I Go Crazy If I Don’t Sleep?

You won’t go crazy if you go too long without sleep, but you can become temporarily delirious.

Sleep deprivation can be dangerous, but it doesn’t cause permanent insanity. This has actually been tested.

Even though heavily sleep-deprived persons can have delirious thoughts and may even hallucinate, once you leave them alone and let them sleep, they’ll return to their usual (sane) self.

## Night Owls versus Morning Larks

Our circadian clock is regulated by genes we inherit from our parents. Variations among these genes predict who identifies as a morning lark and who is more of a night owl.

If you captured a wild rat and only fed it during the day, initially the rat would go hungry. But gradually it would learn that it’s safe to eat during the day, and this genetically nocturnal animal would become more active by day (diurnal). What does this mean for us? That our tendencies are not our destiny! A night owl can adjust to an early-morning exercise routine, and a morning lark can adjust to working the night shift.

The lines blur further the older we get, when it becomes harder to stay up late, whether we’re affirmed night owls or morning larks. This may be related to hormonal changes in the way our bodies handle melatonin.

Both biological and learned factors play a role in our sleep preferences, and understanding the principles guiding our sleep can help us adapt to our changing environments.

## The Skinny on “Second Sleep”

Also known as polyphasic sleep, second sleep is the habit of breaking up your nighttime sleep into two parts, with a period of activity in between. Though it’s become trendy in the digital information age, it’s not a new phenomenon. Historical evidence shows that early humans, especially those living in agrarian societies, took advantage of the cooler nighttime hours to get work done between a first and second sleep. As the modern age dawned and nine-to-five work schedules became the norm, sleeping in a single block of time seemed more efficient, and humans adjusted to this sleep pattern.

## Sleep Is Delicious

Sleep is an appetitive behavior, meaning we have a natural desire to satisfy our need for sleep. And the area of the brain that regulates hunger and eating, the hypothalamus, is also very much involved in the basic regulation of our sleep. In experiments, when an animal is sleep deprived, it will eat more. When humans don’t get enough sleep, they tend not only to seek out food but also to make more impulsive food choices. You may find that a brief nap is more satisfying than any big lunch!

## You Will Always Sleep

Human sleep is homeostatic, meaning that it is a system that seeks balance. The more time you spend awake, the more you need to sleep. As long as you are alive, you cannot indefinitely stop yourself from sleeping—that would be like voluntarily trying to hold your breath. Eventually your biology will force you to breathe again. And so it goes with sleep. It’s a natural process, one people with insomnia should take to heart: As a homeostatic function of the brain, sleep will eventually return.

# Snoring

Before you can address any behavioral or environmental factors that may be affecting your sleep, you need to rule out physical ones.

## It’s Never Normal to Snore

Snoring during sleep is common, but it is also a red flag that something is wrong. People don’t snore when they’re awake, after all. Why, from an evolutionary standpoint, would we tip off our presence to predators when our guard is down? Snoring would be a dinner bell!

It’s common to snore in transient situations—such as when recovering from a cold, for example—but otherwise sleeping should be silent. The sounds of snoring indicate that some kind of abnormal airflow obstruction or turbulence is causing you to have difficulty breathing, forcing you to mouth breathe in your sleep. It’s a simple concept: If you don’t get enough air in through your nose, your mouth will drop open. This often happens when we exercise. It should not happen when you sleep.

If you find yourself waking frequently in the night with a dry mouth or needing to drink water, it may indicate that you are mouth breathing in your sleep. If you occasionally share sleeping space with a friend or family member (while traveling, for example), give that person permission to let you know if you snore. Or simply record yourself as you sleep during the night.

if you hear someone snoring, let them know. You might be saving their life.

## Obstructive Sleep Apnea

The word apnea means “absence of breathing,” and a sleep apnea episode occurs when someone stops breathing during sleep. Plainly speaking, during a sleep apnea episode, sleeping is momentarily more important than breathing to your brain.

The cardinal symptoms are fatigue and snoring, but the disorder can also induce heart attacks and strokes. Apnea’s disruptions to sleep alone can cause behavioral changes and memory or learning problems. The good news is, obstructive sleep apnea may well be one of the most treatable health-care problems.

One of the most common (and successful) remedies for sleep apnea is the nightly use of a CPAP machine; other options include an oral mouthpiece, corrective surgery, or—if your obstructive sleep apnea is relatively mild—behavioral fixes such as losing weight, not sleeping on your back, or avoiding alcohol close to bedtime.

The sleep study is administered during the time a person typically sleeps, for most people overnight. This all-night sleep recording is called a polysomnogram (PSG). A PSG measures a person’s brain waves, eye movements, body movements, muscle tone, breathing patterns, oxygen levels, and heart rhythm. For the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, the recording will add up how often the patient either stopped breathing entirely (apneas) or had episodes of shallow breathing that resulted in drops in oxygen levels and disrupted sleep (hypopneas). The total number of apneas and hypopneas during the night divided by the total hours of sleep is calculated as the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). If the AHI is greater than five events per hour, the diagnosis of sleep apnea is confirmed. An AHI of greater than thirty indicates severe sleep apnea.

Overlooked, sleep apnea may complicate the treatment of other health problems. Doctors often see patients with complex medical situations and myriad complaints that are hard to sort into a single, clear diagnosis. Sleep apnea acts like a fog, getting in the way of clearly seeing what else is going on with the patient. Address your sleep apnea, and you may find that treatments that previously failed for other ailments now work! When obstructive sleep apnea is remedied, you really get a fresh start.

## CPAP Will Turbo-Charge Your Sleep

When we fall asleep, the muscles in our throat relax and our airway can become too narrow, making it harder to inflate our lungs. The work of breathing increases, and we have to create more negative pressure to inhale. It’s like trying to drink a milkshake through a very thin straw. A cascade of events can ensue, culminating in obstructive sleep apnea and all of its potential dire consequences.

A CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine is a bedside device successfully used by millions of people to treat obstructive sleep apnea. A CPAP machine features a hose with a mask that forces positive pressure through your nose. This positive pressure counteracts the negative pressure that is causing your airway to implode when you have obstructive sleep apnea. The invention of the CPAP machine was inspired by reversing the flow of a vacuum cleaner, and the original CPAP machines were just as loud as those household appliances. Modern CPAP devices, however, are nearly silent. They are certainly quieter than snoring!

## But I Don’t Want a CPAP Machine!

An oral appliance can treat obstructive sleep apnea by moving the tongue to create more space to breathe. There are dozens of varieties of oral appliances on the market; look for those custom-made by dentists trained in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. Oral appliance treatments have the advantage of being more discreet than a CPAP machine. Looking much like boxers’ mouthpieces, they don’t require electricity and are easy to travel with. But a custom-made oral appliance can be considerably more expensive than a CPAP machine, and oral appliances address obstructive sleep apnea only at the level of the tongue, meaning they may not be fully effective when someone has additional levels of obstruction (such as in the soft palate or nose area). Since many oral appliances move the jaw, they can also sometimes cause pain in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) area or throw off the alignment of a person’s teeth. If you’re interested in using an oral appliance, you’ll need a repeat sleep study to ensure that the device is truly effective, as well as regular visits to the dentist to make sure the device is working correctly and your teeth are not becoming misaligned. All of this adds to the cost of treatment, but many people who wish to avoid a CPAP machine swear by oral appliances.

For many people with obstructive sleep apnea, weight loss is an effective solution. The good news is that losing a relatively small amount of weight can have a big impact on your breathing while you sleep. Many people, especially men, put on weight around the neck, narrowing the throat area and obstructing breathing. Losing roughly 10 to 15 percent of your body weight can drastically open up the space in the throat area and help you breathe better at night. The bad news is that for these same reasons, relatively small increases in weight can lead to disproportionate worsening of the obstruction. (It’s important to note, though, that not only overweight people suffer from sleep apnea!)

## Other Snoring Solutions

If sleep apnea is ruled out and you still snore, physical factors such as a nasal septum deviation might be the culprit, in which case an ear, nose, and throat surgeon can correct the problem and help you breathe better while both asleep and awake, and especially when exercising. Nasal obstruction is common in people with allergies.

# Sleep for the Insomniac

The need for sleep is biological; the way we sleep is learned. Much like learning to eat, we are taught to sleep. All newborn babies drink milk, but five-year-olds around the world have different diets. It’s the same with sleep. Even if the origin of your sleep problems is physical, poor sleep lasting a few months or longer almost always has a behavioral component. And once physical barriers to sleep have been dealt with, the learned behavior is what to focus on.

The right approach to most behavioral sleep problems can be counterintuitive. Many of my patients who are computer engineers in Silicon Valley take a very analytical approach to sleep but end up only messing it up!

## Transient versus Chronic Insomnia

This inability to sleep well lasts from one or two nights to one or two weeks. it’s often the result of some short-lasting precipitating circumstance—anxiety over the events of the previous day, or too much caffeine.

This is known as transient insomnia. The danger with transient insomnia is not sleep loss per se but rather the accumulating sleep debt.

Insomnia episodes that occur repeatedly need more attention. The problem with chronic insomnia is that its sufferers’ sleep becomes unpredictable; they are in a trap. Chronic insomnia can persist for months and even years.

“chronic” when it lasts more than three months—and necessitates a completely different approach than that of transient insomnia.

## Living with Chronic Insomnia

After months or years of dealing with unpredictable sleep quality, insomniacs have learned to be hypervigilant about sleep. The thought of sleeping wakes them up! They don’t go to bed in a state of serenity, but rather one of uncertainty, wondering how bad their insomnia will be that night. Or they dwell on the past, triggering regrets and uneasiness. Worst of all, they convince themselves that tomorrow will depend on how well they sleep tonight.

Imagine a similar scenario involving eating. what if your access to food is unpredictable? What if you feel that the quality of food you’ll receive is out of your control? What if on some days plenty of good food is available, but on others food is scarce? You might start obsessively stashing food for times of want, and from the moment you wake up until you hit the bed at night, you will be thinking about food. Similarly, when sleep becomes unpredictable, anxiety and hypervigilance understandably result.

Insomnia is often a family affair. When the family makes a good-faith effort to be quiet, and the loved one still has a poor night of sleep, it can pile on more guilt and self-blame—exacerbating an already tenuous situation. In most cases, the insomniac’s sleep is not dependent on the behavior of their family but on getting to the root of their own sleep issues.

Most insomniacs’ sleep problems can improve. It is usually a learned behavior; therefore treatable!

## Good Sleep Patterns Take Time

You’re not going to change years of poor sleep in just a few days. These are ingrained patterns that are resistant to disruption—and often we want to sleep so badly we give up before we can solidify new habits.

To make sleep changes truly stick, strive to practice the techniques for six to eight weeks. Expect to feel new sleep habits take hold after a couple of weeks, followed by steady, noticeable improvement.

keep a sleep diary to track the amount of time you’re in bed, also record what kind of day you’re having: Are you feeling refreshed, alert? Or are you feeling fatigued, listless, irritable? By reviewing your notes, you can track your sleep improvements over time.

## Insomnia Is a Thinker’s Condition

We are all amnestic as we fall asleep. (You may be able to tell me what time you went to bed, but you cannot tell me what time you fell asleep!) It’s far better to set up a scheduled thinking time prior to bedtime, to help get this worry out of your system well before you need to sleep.

Most people are never alone with their thoughts until they hop into bed, when the day’s distractions fall away. While it’s true that the brain never actually turns off, there are effective techniques to keep racing or recurring thoughts from disturbing your sleep.

Sit in a quiet place, away from the bedroom, for approximately fifteen to thirty minutes every night, with a paper notebook—not a laptop or phone and write down whatever you need to accomplish tomorrow. Start with writing down mundane tasks such as chores. Then list those things you’ve been meaning to do but haven’t gotten around to. Give yourself some time to be alone with these thoughts, then close the notebook and tell yourself, “I am done with my day; whatever is not done can wait till tomorrow.” Say it and believe it.

If your mind starts to race again, remind yourself that the important stuff is already written down, the day is over, and you are prepared for tomorrow. In the morning when you wake up, take a moment to reread what you wrote the previous night. You’ll find that the problems you were so worried about often seem less burdensome in the morning light. Continue with scheduled thinking time every night as a routine.

## Escape the Worry Trap

If you go to bed thinking that tomorrow’s success depends on how well you sleep tonight, you are setting yourself up for a troubled night of sleep. Sleeping is one of our most potentially dangerous activities—it’s when we are at our most vulnerable. Your brain interprets danger and stress as the same thing and sleeping lightly or not at all is its biological response to an alert that something is wrong.

Sleep is a homeostatic function of the brain.Homeostasis is the mechanism that a biological system uses to achieve balance. This means that our brain strives to restore itself during sleep.

Don’t be hard on yourself if you wake up during the night; remember, waking frequently is a normal function of a sleep cycle. Trying to stop this process only sets in motion an endless vicious cycle of waking fitfully and sleeping in spurts. Comfort yourself by knowing that sleep will return. The brain’s homeostatic drive guarantees it.

## Lock In a Wake-up Time

One of the first steps in fixing a behavioral component of a sleep problem is to lock in a wake-up time. The fact is, it is much easier to force yourself to wake up at a specific time than to fall asleep. If you wake up and get out of bed at the same time every day, eventually your robust biological clock will also help make the time at which you fall asleep more predictable.

## Increase Your Sleep Gradually

Blame the conflict between the homeostatic drive for sleep and the circadian fluctuation in the sleep/wake schedule. Your homeostatic system may want you to sleep longer, while your circadian system—anticipating that “dawn” will occur about the same time that it occurred the previous morning—wakes you before you get the additional sleep you crave.

If you are trying to increase your average daily sleep time by one hour, introduce your new habits gradually. For a week or two, go to bed only fifteen minutes earlier than usual and get out of bed fifteen minutes later than usual. If you find yourself falling asleep easily and waking up on time, repeat the process, going to bed fifteen minutes earlier and waking up fifteen minutes later. Extending your sleep by thirty minutes, getting used to this new routine, then adding another thirty minutes is an easier way of accomplishing your goal of extending total sleep time by an hour.

## Hacks for Getting Back to Sleep

The more the bed is used for activities other than sleep, the weaker the connection will be between bed and sleep. Let this be your mantra: `The bedroom is for sleeping`.

- **Don’t look at the clock.**
  Turn your alarm facing away from you, if you must. If you want to know what time it is, it’s nighttime, that’s what time it is!
- **Lie calmly and focus on your breathing.**
  Reassure yourself that sleep will come. It always does.
- **If after a few minutes you find yourself getting restless, get up and leave your bedroom.**
  Don’t do anything productive such as chores or work (this will serve as a positive reinforcement of your difficulty staying asleep). Read something of no value—your refrigerator warranty, for example.
- **Don’t turn on the computer or TV.**
  Finding something interesting to read or watch will only make things worse by rewarding the insomnia and the vicious cycle it perpetuates. Again, pick up that refrigerator warranty!
- **Don’t grab a snack.**
  Eating can also be a reward, reinforcing your insomnia (not to mention that late-night eating correlates to weight gain).
- **Keep reminding yourself that your sleepiness will eventually return.**
  When that happens, get back in bed—not on a couch or chair.

## You Don’t Want to Sleep like a Baby . . .

It is a misconception that infancy is the best sleep time of our lives. The reality is that babies sleep only for brief periods, with sleep cycles regularly interrupted by a need to feed every two to four hours during the night.

## You Do Want to Sleep like a Nine-Year-Old . . .

When you are nine years old, you don’t need to worry about the rent or mortgage. You are woken up, given breakfast, and delivered to school. Nine-year-olds tend to fall asleep easily, appear to sleep through the night, and wake up refreshed. During the day, they are full of energy and don’t nap.

These children have a consistent routine, and they fall asleep in a state of serenity, feeling safe, comfortable, and loved. It’s how we should all sleep.

You’ll sleep better if you go to bed in the right frame of mind. No matter how much stress you are under when you are awake, you will sleep better if you reframe your mindset, give yourself a little love and positive reinforcement, and tuck yourself in. Your life is a reflection of how you sleep, and how you sleep is a reflection of your life.

## Distinguish between Being Tired and Sleepy

If you got up and did one hundred jumping jacks, you might feel tired, but it’s likely you won’t feel sleepy.

The terms tired and sleepy actually mean two different things. This is a simple but important distinction. You could spend a full week in a luxury hotel room doing nothing at all. You won’t feel tired, but you will periodically sleep. Low thyroid hormone levels can also make you feel tired but not sleepy. Make a point in distinguishing sheer fatigue from sleepiness, because each requires a different solution. If you are tired, you need to rest, and if you are sleepy, you need to sleep.

## Think of Napping like Snacking

Napping can decrease your appetite for sleep and hinder your ability to get a full night’s sleep—but it can also satisfy the sleep hunger of the sleep deprived. (In fact, if you start having vivid dreams during a very short nap, that’s a sure sign you are sleep deprived.)

Ideally, naps should be brief. Somewhere around forty minutes should satisfy. Longer naps, especially more than ninety minutes, can make you feel sluggish when you awaken. This phenomenon is sometimes called sleep drunkenness and is attributed to a physiological process called sleep inertia. In essence, once we sleep that long, we want to keep sleeping, so we wake up feeling out of sorts.

A short nap during the day, however, can do wonders to energize you. If you had a quick lunch and took a twenty-minute power nap during the rest of your break time, you’d finish the day a more alert, productive, and happy employee!

Try to nap in the same place you sleep at night. It’s further reinforcement that bed is the place for sleeping.

## CBT-I for Good Sleep

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has an impressive success rate in treating insomnia.

CBT-I can be done in group settings, or one-on-one with a therapist. People with milder forms of insomnia may find they can apply CBT-I principles on their own and improve their sleep (there are apps available online).

More than two-thirds of people with chronic insomnia who undergo CBT-I are able to sleep better without relying on medications in about two months.

The goal of CBT-I is to give you information to help you think differently about sleep and to make behavioral adjustments that result in incremental improvements. These improvements inspire further changes in your thinking and behavior, and gradually, the process snowballs to reverse the vicious cycle of insomnia.

CBT-I behavioral technique, dictates a narrower window of time that you actually spend in bed, typically five and a half to seven hours, with a fixed wake-up time (regardless of how well you slept the night before). Sleep is avoided at any other time of the day. Under sleep restriction, the body’s homeostatic drive improves the ability to stay asleep. As sleep improves, you gradually increase the time in bed (short intervals of fifteen to thirty minutes about once a week) until you are satisfied with the amount of sleep you are getting.

As you work through this sleep restriction process, you might apply stimulus control as well. Typical stimulus control instructions are designed to reinforce the connection between the bedroom and sleep, and include going to bed only when you are sleepy and getting out of bed when you cannot sleep.

Along with sleep restriction and stimulus control, you can also incorporate relaxation exercises or mindfulness meditation. The aim is to push away ruminating, worried thoughts about your sleep. One of my favorite techniques to help stem these ruminating thoughts is scheduled thinking time.

# A Day in the Night Life

## Exercise and Sleep

Even as little as ten minutes a day—helps people fall asleep faster, increases total sleep time, and improves overall sleep quality. Physical activity increases the secretion of human growth hormone (HGH), which promotes restorative, deeper sleep. Overall fitness helps keep weight down and improves your mood, which also lead to healthier sleep. Exercise bolsters sleep in other ways, too, such as by reducing stress.

More recent studies have found that the timing of exercise may not really matter. Evening exercise can make it harder to fall asleep, but once some people fall asleep, their sleep itself is deeper. Doing vigorous exercise within an hour of bedtime still has the potential to disrupt sleep, so get your routine in well before you hit the sack. But don’t use the time of day as an excuse not to exercise.

## Meditation for Mindful Sleep

It has been said that sleep is the best meditation.
Mindfulness techniques train our minds to stay in the moment and not wander off on self-defeating tangents of regret and worry.

You can practice meditation anywhere and anytime, but for poor sleepers it’s best to start in a quiet, calming environment, right before you go to bed. Close your eyes and focus on steady, deep, natural breathing. You can visualize a relaxing scene (a beach or fluffy clouds) or place your hand on your belly and focus on the rising and falling of your breath. Or imagine your breath slowly making its way up from your toes to your head every time you inhale. There are many apps available that offer guided meditations, including some specifically focused on sleeping.

Try to commit to meditating for ten minutes a day for at least eight weeks before you decide it’s not helpful.

## Does Sex Make People Sleepy?

In general, having an orgasm can help you feel sleepy if you are already in the mood to sleep (an orgasm releases prolactin, which promotes sleepiness and relaxation, along with oxytocin, which promotes calmness and social bonding). But given the physical exertion and flood of chemical changes, sex makes others feel energized.

## Alcohol Is a Double-Edged Sword

Alcohol is a sedative, the sleep you get is more akin to feeling knocked out than sleeping restfully. Even worse, alcohol can exacerbate serious sleep conditions like obstructive sleep apnea.

A number of over-the-counter nighttime sleep aids rely on a combination of alcohol and antihistamines. The alcohol helps initiate sleep quickly and the antihistamine helps a person maintain sleep. However, the efficacy of these products wears off quickly—after a few days—and they become unreliable.

## Caffeine Is Complicated

Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychostimulant worldwide, with 90 percent of adults reporting regular caffeine use.

New research on how caffeine is metabolized by our bodies and how it affects our brains tells us that the old rules are not that simple anymore.

Ultimately, listen to your own body. If you see no ill effects from your after-dinner cup, enjoy!

Our brains run on a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). As our ATP is depleted, a by-product called adenosine builds in our brains. The higher the adenosine levels in our brains, the sleepier we feel. Caffeine blocks our brains’ adenosine receptor, which is why it makes us feel less sleepy. So if you can fall asleep after a shot of espresso, it may mean that you have built up so much adenosine in your brain from sleep debt that coffee is not sufficient to keep you awake.

## Water Is Not a Problem, Until It Is

Normally when we are sleeping, our bodies produce less urine, so we can sleep longer without interruption.

If you consistently wake up thirsty and needing to urinate, you may have sleep apnea. this is especially likely if you also snore or wake up unrefreshed. Having to wake up to get rid of fluid at the same time you need a drink of water means something may be wrong with the biology of your sleep. When there is a narrowing in the throat, such as in obstructive sleep apnea, a cascade of events occurs that culminates in the kidneys making more urine, not less. If the signal to empty your bladder is strong enough, you wake up to urinate. If you sleep through the signal, you will wet the bed. (This is why it’s usually a mistake to restrict water from a child who is bed-wetting. Simply drinking water is not usually the cause of a child’s bed-wetting; other physical factors play a much bigger role.

## Don’t Eat Two Hours Prior to Bedtime

Having a full stomach in bed can exacerbate acid reflux and lead to heartburn, a real sleep disturber.

Late-night consumption of any food is more likely to make us gain weight. It’s even got a name—nocturnal eating syndrome—which is associated with obesity.

It is easy to mindlessly eat when we are sleepy or want to stay awake when we should be asleep.

On the other hand, don’t make a habit of going to bed hungry—it can disrupt sleep, break down muscle mass, and even reinforce eating disorders around sleep.

## Heartburn and Sleep

Heartburn is a symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition caused by stomach acid moving upward into the esophagus. A valve made of muscle at the junction of the esophagus and stomach allows food to enter the stomach and prevents the stomach contents from coming back up the esophagus. But when this valve malfunctions, the result is acid damage. GERD is more common during pregnancy and just one more reason women sleep poorly at this time

For most people, infrequent heartburn is not a serious problem. If persistent, however, heartburn can lead to medical complications, including significant damage to the esophagus and a higher risk of esophageal cancer.

A common strategy to lower the symptoms of GERD is to avoid sleeping flat—by adding pillows to raise the upper half of your body, for example. Decreasing caffeine intake, eating smaller meals, avoiding alcohol close to bedtime, and quitting smoking are also helpful.

## Herbal Tea for Bedtime

Blends to help you sleep typically include valerian and chamomile; chamomile alone does not consistently aid sleep, but valerian has a mild sedative effect and can make you drowsy when you first take it. These sedating properties eventually wear off with nightly use, however, especially if the underlying reason for difficulty sleeping is not addressed.

## The State of Sleeping Pills

Some over-the-counter sleeping aids can cause more dangerous overdose reactions than current prescription sleeping pills. Occasionally using a hypnotic to help you fight off temporary insomnia is okay.

When people report that they can’t sleep without their prescription sleeping pill, its usage has become a problem. One of the main reasons sleeping pills require prescriptions is that they can be habit forming. The overall goal of any sleep medication is that the patient sleeps easily throughout the night and wakes up refreshed without relying on medication. Most people with insomnia sleep better when the root cause of their insomnia is addressed.

## Skip “Natural” Sleep Aids for More Natural Sleep

Being sedated is not the same as naturally sleeping. In general, these aids are best used for the occasional bout of insomnia; when it comes to chronic insomnia, many sleep aids that seem to work at first eventually lose efficacy. In the long run, relying on supplements does not address the underlying causes for poor sleep. Here’s a rundown of the most popular supplements on the market.

- Cannabidiol (CBD):
  Number of anecdotal reports show that CBD may actually be helpful in the treatment of insomnia. But until randomized long-term clinical trials are completed, it’s hard to recommend CBD. We need to see if benefits are sustained, and if there is any downside.
- GABA, or gamma-aminobutyric acid:
  An amino acid and one of the most important neurotransmitters in the brain, many common prescription sleeping pills (such as Ambien) work by increasing the activity of GABA in our brains. This naturally occurring chemical is also sold in over-the-counter supplements; when GABA is digested by your stomach, however, it is unlikely to have much of an effect on your brain and cannot reliably make you very sleepy.
- Magnesium:
  has a calming effect; milk of magnesium used as a laxative works to relax our intestinal muscles. But the evidence that magnesium supplements help with chronic insomnia is not strong.
- Melatonin:
  is a naturally occurring hormone released by the pineal gland in the brain in anticipation of the evening. Melatonin supplements may help adults fall asleep faster but it does not aid in staying asleep or significantly increasing the total sleep time in most people. The purity and quality of various melatonin preparations fluctuate widely—what is labeled on the bottle is often very different from what is in the actual pills. This fluctuation may be a reason that reactions to it vary, with some folks saying melatonin doesn’t work and others claiming it knocks them out.

## The Blue-Light Effect

Blue color light frequencies play a special role in our body’s circadian clock and our sleep schedule. A type of photoreceptor in our eyes, called intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, preferentially react to light in the blue spectrum to help regulate our circadian rhythms. Once it was understood that these special neurons preferentially react to blue light, the idea of blocking out the blue-light frequencies coming off of our screens became popular, because it theoretically allows us to use these devices late at night without causing significant shifts in the circadian system.

Blue-light filtering strategies do work to decrease the effects of light on delaying our circadian clock, but the blue-light frequencies are not the only reason electronic devices keep us up at night. Our engagement with the devices and their content likely plays a much bigger role. Using blue-light blockers is like putting a filter on a cigarette. Yes, it can help, but it doesn’t address the core problem.

## White Noise: A Sonic Lullaby

White noise is a machine-generated sound designed to mask these disruptive sonic shifts and provide a consistent, pleasing sound throughout the night. White-noise machines work by introducing a uniform background noise to our environment that we become accustomed to and associate with sleep.

A white-noise machine is a useful tool for anyone who sleeps in an unpleasantly noisy environment, especially if the noise is intermittent or unpredictable.

Some white-noise machines play only one tone, while others have all sorts of comforting tracks, from nature sounds like rain or ocean surf to ambient noises like whirring fans. Inexpensive white-noise apps can also work, but many of these devices use recordings that loop and repeat, which can disturb a person who is hypervigilant to noise and looping repetition.

White noise is not the only game in town. While white-noise sound includes all frequencies audible to the human ear at the same volume, other types of machines filter out only certain frequencies. Pink noise has some higher frequencies filtered out, so it sounds more like rain. Brown noise has even more high frequencies filtered out, giving it more of a low-tone rumble. In the end, it’s all about personal preference. When you find one that works for you, it can be a lifetime comfort.

## Earplugs for Sleeping

They help block noise and are incredibly easy to use. And they work fine as a temporary solution to an unusual and noisy sleeping situation, like when staying somewhere other than your own home. When a person believes earplugs are essential to their sleep, however, it’s a problem.

People with insomnia suffer from unpredictable sleep quality. If on a given night they use earplugs and get a solid night of sleep, they suddenly become hypervigilant around noise. Now, because they are going to sleep believing they must be vigilant about noises to help themselves sleep, their brain forces them to sleep more lightly. In time, they do sleep more lightly, and the earplugs stop being effective.

## The Bed as a Place for Sleeping

Using the bed only for sleeping is part of the standard sleep hygiene rules. The idea being that if you use the bed for other activities such as reading or watching TV, your body will get used to being awake in bed.

People who tell they like to read in bed but feel guilty about it because it’s “bad.” Well, it is bad—if you struggle to sleep at night. If you sleep well, you can do whatever you like in bed!

## Most Like It Cool

Although preferences depend on the individual, keeping the bedroom temperature between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit (15.5 to 21 degrees Celsius) should help facilitate sleep.

One of the unexplained aspects of sleep is that while we are typically able to maintain an average core body temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius), this regulation of our core temperature decreases when we are in REM sleep, a phenomenon called poikilothermy. Since REM dominates the last third of the night, this may be why in the beginning of the night we kick off our covers, but in the early-morning hours we are fighting over the blankets with our bed partner.

## Night Light

Experiencing artificial light at night can trick our brains into behaving as if it is a short summer night, causing us to go to sleep later. If you’re having trouble sleeping, start gradually limiting your exposure to light sources about two hours before bedtime; leave electronic devices out of the bedroom and turn any lighted clocks away from sight lines. Blackout blinds and eye masks can further block unwanted light.

## It’s Probably Not the Mattress

Insomniacs sleep better away from home because they associate their own bedrooms with places of frustration and lack of shut-eye. They may (inaccurately) attribute their improved sleep to the change in mattress instead of the overall environment.

If you are having trouble sleeping in the first place, is a new mattress the answer? If your old, lumpy mattress is clearly in need of replacing, sure, but otherwise, probably not.

Think back to how you slept as a child. You could blissfully fall asleep on the floor of a friend’s home with just a blanket and pillow. As a teenager, you were happy sleeping on a friend’s couch. There is very little independent scientific data that suggests that changing mattresses makes a difference in improving poor sleep for most people.

## Pillow Talk

When buying a pillow, look for one that conforms naturally to the contours of your head and neck, like a feather or memory-foam pillow. Pillows that are thick and firm may force your neck into an unnatural flexed position. So-called cervical pillows have built-in support to ergonomically align the neck and are contoured to cradle the natural curvature of shoulders, head, and neck. Japanese sobakawa pillows are filled with natural buckwheat hulls; they conform to the head and neck and maintain their firm shape.

## Scent and Sleep

Evidence shows that aromatherapy can have some benefits. The smell of lavender, for example, is reported to have a calming effect and was shown to provide subjective improvements in sleep in multiple studies. This is because when we fall asleep, our brain goes through a process of perceptual disengagement as it turns inward, becoming less responsive to external stimuli. But one sense does remain “online” even when we are deeply asleep: our sense of smell, a holdover from prehistoric times when we needed to be alert to predators’ scents.
