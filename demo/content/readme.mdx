# Welcome to Vidyāmaṇḍala

Vidyāmaṇḍala is <Highlight color="#fc9f5b">Circle of Knowledge</Highlight> in Sanskrit, a fancy name that I gave to this [[digital-garden]] aka Working Notes, as part of [[public-learning]] and networked thought. ( :construction: WIP :construction: )

Writing notes and linking them with each other, by allowing this intersection of different ideas we make [[idea-sex]] happen.

These notes are how I understand ideas, concepts. By putting them into words I am not just proving that I understand something but I am also improving them.

[[writing-is-thinking]], these notes not just aid me in remembering things but they also help me think better, allowing me to create more.

Some of these ideas are seedlings, some budding and some evergreen, always evolving, getting better as my understanding of these ideas get better.

Borrowing from [Andy's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/):  
Evergreen notes are supposed to be <Highlight color="#5aa9e6"> atomic, conceptually-oriented, densely linked,
and associated </Highlight> with other similar ideas rather than following a hierarchy.

While I don't intend to structure them into categories, my writings will fall mostly into these [[themes]].

The beauty and the advantage of this approach for learning things is that it challenges your existing [[mental-models]], beliefs, assumptions and you don't have to be ashamed of updating these notes if you turn out to be wrong about things.
