# Soldier Mindset

Soldier mindset is the default setting on which your mind operates, that is how we perceive reality, people, ourselves.

It keeps us from changing ourselves for better, it makes us act irrational and defensive against new ideas.

Soldier mindset is also known as [[directionally-motivated-reasoning]] the opposite of [[accuracy-motivated-reasoning]]

Why do we like to latch on to soldier mindset can be explained and categorized into the following:

- comfort
- self-esteem
- morale
- persuasion
- image
- belonging.

## Comfort: Avoiding unpleasant emotions

Soldier mindset helps us avoid negative emotions like fear, stress, and regret. Sometimes we do that with denial. Other times, we reach for comforting narratives about the world, and opt not to scrutinize them too closely. **Everything happens for the best**. **People get what’s coming to them**. **The darker the night, the brighter the stars**.

when it doesn’t seem feasible to fix a problem, we may try to convince ourselves that our “problem” is actually a blessing, and that we wouldn’t change it even if we could.

We're chasing a sweet relief, to avoid dealing with problems, to rationalize things we don't have control over, in matters like these we rely on soldier mindset. To comfort ourselves from harsh truth that we cannot do anything about.

## Self-esteem: Feeling good about ourselves

we often use soldier mindset to protect our egos by finding flattering narratives for unflattering facts. **I may not be wealthy, but that’s because I have integrity**. **The reason I don’t have a lot of friends is because people are intimidated by me**.

All sorts of beliefs can get drafted into service defending our egos because they relate in some way to our strengths or weaknesses.

Over time, our beliefs about the world adjust to accommodate our track record.

Your self-image shapes even your most fundamental beliefs about how the world works. Poorer people are more likely to believe that luck plays a big role in life, while wealthier people tend to credit hard work and talent alone.

Psychologists make a distinction between self-enhancement, which means boosting your ego with positive beliefs, and self-protection, which means avoiding blows to your ego. For the sake of self-protection, you might err on the side of assuming the worst about yourself. In a popular video, YouTuber Natalie Wynn calls it “masochistic epistemology”—whatever hurts is true.

## Morale: Motivating ourselves to do hard things

We assume that irrational optimism is a good thing—it’s what motivates you to launch yourself into daunting challenges, _ignore the naysayers, and persevere when things get tough._

Selectively focusing on the features of a situation that justify optimism, while ignoring those that justify pessimism.

We need morale to make tough decisions and act on them with conviction. That’s why decision-makers often avoid considering alternative plans or downsides to their current plan.

Comfort, self-esteem, and morale are emotional benefits, meaning that the ultimate target of our deception is ourselves. The next three benefits of soldier mindset are a little different. Persuasion, image, and belonging are social benefits—in these cases, the ultimate target of our deception is other people, by way of ourselves.

## Persuation: convinving ourselves so we can convince others

When we need to persuade other people of something, we become motivated to believe it ourselves, and seek out arguments and evidence we could use in its defense.

As an entrepreneur, if you can talk with sincere enthusiasm about how your company is “totally killing it right now,” other people might believe it, too. Lobbyists, salespeople, and fund-raisers might play up the strengths and play down the flaws in their cause or product to make it easier for them to sell it to other people.

The more we can get ourselves to genuinely believe something, and the more evidence and arguments we can collect to support it, the easier it will be for us to persuade other people of it (or so the logic goes).

## Image: choosing beliefs that make us look good

Psychologists call it impression management, and evolutionary psychologists call it signaling: When considering a claim, we implicitly ask ourselves, “What kind of person would believe a claim like this, and is that how I want other people to see me?”

_ Someone sophisticated, free-spirited, unconventional, down to earth? Is that how I want other people to see me?”_

One person might be drawn to nihilism because it makes him seem edgy, while another might be drawn to optimism because it makes him likeable. Still another might gravitate toward moderate positions on controversial issues in order to seem mature. Note that the goal here isn’t to get other people to share your beliefs, the way it is in the case of “Persuasion.” The nihilist isn’t trying to get other people to believe in nihilism. He’s trying to get them to believe that he believes in nihilism.

When an idea begins to gain currency in your social circles, you might be motivated to adopt it as well in order to remain fashionable. That is, unless being contrarian is part of your image, in which case an idea’s growing popularity might make you less receptive to it, not more.

Despite all the variety, some preferences about self-presentation are near universal. Almost no one wants to hold beliefs that make them look crazy or selfish. So for the sake of our image, we reach for defensible explanations for our behavior.

## Belonging: fitting in to your social groups

In some religious communities, losing your faith can mean losing your marriage, family, and entire social support system along with it. That’s an extreme case, but all social groups have some beliefs and values that members are implicitly expected to share.

Dissent may not get you literally kicked out of the group, but it can still alienate you from the other members.

To be clear, deferring to a consensus isn’t inherently a sign of soldier mindset. In the web comic XKCD, a parent asks their child that age-old rhetorical question: “If all your friends jumped off a bridge, would you jump, too?” The correct answer is presumed to be a grudging “No, of course not.” But the child replies, “Probably,” because after all, which is more likely—that his friends all went crazy at the same time or that the bridge is on fire?17 The kid’s got a point. Deferring to the consensus is often a wise heuristic, since you can’t investigate everything for yourself, and other people know things you don’t.

What makes it motivated reasoning is when you wouldn’t even want to find out if the consensus was wrong.

We feel sick when we get 'wrong answers', when we find out things that don't fit into our existing group consensus.

Fitting in isn’t only about conforming to the group consensus. It also means demonstrating your loyalty to the group by rejecting any evidence that threatens its figurative honor.

And in some groups, fitting in comes with restrictions on what you’re allowed to want or to believe about yourself. It’s been called tall poppy syndrome: anyone who seems like they’re trying to be a “tall poppy,” showing too much self-regard or ambition, is cut down to size. If you want to fit in to such a culture, you might acquire the habit of downplaying your achievements and goals—even in the privacy of your own mind.

---

We use motivated reasoning not because we don’t know any better, but because we’re trying to protect things that are vitally important to us—our ability to feel good about our lives and ourselves, our motivation to try hard things and stick with them, our ability to look good and persuade, and our acceptance in our communities.

Even when soldier mindset doesn’t completely backfire, it’s still not obvious that it’s our best option and how [[scout-mindset]] is better. Rather than boosting your self-esteem by denying your flaws, you could instead boost your self-esteem by noticing and fixing those flaws. Rather than pursuing social acceptance by suppressing your disagreements with your community, you could instead decide to leave and find a different community you fit in to better.
